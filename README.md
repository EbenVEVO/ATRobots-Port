# ATRobots-Port
This was a school project in a software engineering class I worked on with two other classmates.

This game is a port of a game AT-Robots, originally wrote in pascal, to Java this was a group prroject and my contribution was the game simulation itself.
User can encrypt text files with lock feature in the GUI. The GUI is also used to add robots/tanks to the game simulation which sends these tanks to battle.

This was only worked on for a semester so there are noticible bugs in my contribution.

The robots often damage themselves when they shoot out projectiles this a major bug I was never able to fix during the project.
